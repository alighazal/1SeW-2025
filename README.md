# One Solution Every Week (1SeW)

Welcome to the **One Solution Every Week** (1SeW) repository! The goal of this project is to foster consistent coding
habits by solving at least one simple problem every week in your favorite programming language. It's a fun and flexible
way to stay sharp, learn new things, and build a personal archive of solutions.

## Rules

### 1. Solve a Problem Weekly

- Solve a simple problem every week in your favorite programming language.
- The problem can range from a basic algorithm (e.g., Bubble Sort) to a test case (e.g., checking if a number is Prime
  number).

### 2. Repository Naming

- Name your repository in the format: `1SeW-yyyy`. For example, for the year 2025, the repository name would be
  `1SeW-2025`.

### 3. Folder Naming

- Create a folder for each week's solution using the format: `wXX_solution_name`, where:
    - `XX` is the week number with a leading zero (e.g., `w01` for the first week).
    - `solution_name` is a concise description of the solution.
- Example: `w01_bubble_sort` for the first week's solution.
- _Tip:_ You can find the current week number by visiting websites like whatisthisweek.com or by running the command:
  `date +%V` (on Unix/Linux-based systems).

### 4. Organizing Files

- Place all files related to a solution inside the respective folder.
- Each week's solution should be self-contained and should run independently.

### 5. Optional README

- Optionally include a `README.md` inside the week's folder to add more details about the problem or the solution if
  required.

### 6. Handling Multiple Solutions in a Week

- If you solve multiple problems in a single week, create separate folders for each solution.
- Use the same week number but a unique solution name for each folder.
- Example:
    - `w01_bubble_sort`
    - `w01_fizz_buzz`

### 7. Committing Code

- You can make as many commits as you like throughout the week.
- Just ensure that you maintain the directory structure and keep up with the weekly streak.

### 8. Skipping Weeks

- If you are unable to contribute during a particular week, skip that week's folder entirely.

### 9. Use of Different Programming Languages

- It is recommended to pick a single programming language and a monorepo project structure for simplicity.
- However, if you want to use multiple languages and can manage them effectively, that's totally fine. Just ensure that
  you maintain the folder structure for each week's solution.
