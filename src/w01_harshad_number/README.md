# Harshad Numbers or Niven Numbers

I found this interesting discussion in an [HN thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42564581) that 2025 is a "
harshad number". By definition, a [harshad number (or Niven number)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harshad_number) in a
given number base is an integer that is divisible by the sum of its digits when written in that base.

For example, the number 18 is a harshad number in base 10, because the sum of the digits 1 and 8 is 9, and 18 is
divisible by 9. Similarly, 2025 is divisible by 9 (2+0+2+5).
